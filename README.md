# Applied-DataScience-Capstone-Project
Final Capstone Project - Files for Evaluation

**Coursera Capstone Project Description:** 

"In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully."

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.Applied Data Science Capstone is targetted to apply  data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company.    

**Methodology:**
- Source for raw data was provided, first steps was to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 
- Followed by exploring the processed data.  
- Practice for SQL skills to query the data and gather insights was presented.  
- Insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, was targetted to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   
- Finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in your data.  

**Dataset:**

All dataset used and generated during the course are presented as csv files

**Juputer Source Code covering all 8 modules**

Presented here are all 8 jupyter files along with soloutions as part of evaluation.
